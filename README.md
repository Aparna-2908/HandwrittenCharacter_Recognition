# HandwrittenCharacter_Recognition
This project uses techniques such as deep learning algorithms and neural networks that have been employed to improve recognition rates.
It uses packages such as open-cv, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pyscreenshot and joblib.
It is divided into four parts:
i) Collecting images
ii) Generate dataset
iii) Train the model and calculate it's frequency
iv) Live Prediction
